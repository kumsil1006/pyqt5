pyqt5 (5.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Update debian/copyright, thanks Paul Tagliamonte for comments.
  * Use xz compression for binary packages.
  * Install files to python3-dbus.mainloop.pyqt5{,-dbg} directly instead of
    generating .install files. This fixes a problem of the -dbg package being
    not installable because of unwanted debug-id files (closes: #718551).

  [ Scott Kitterman ]
  * Add debian/patches/arm_compile.patch, cherry picked from upstream to
    enable builds on arm (replaces qreal_float_support.diff that was used in
    python-qt4)
  * Remove pycache directories left over in pyqt5-doc

pyqt5 (5.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Initial release, based on python-qt4 packaging (closes: #712630).
  * debian/patches/mainloop_rename.diff: upstream patch to rename
    dbus.mainloop.qt module to dbus.mainloop.pyqt5, to prevent conflicts
    with PyQt4.

  [ Scott Kitterman ]
  * Add call to dh_installdocs in debian/rules
  * Added doc-base registration, debian/pyqt5-doc.doc-base
  * Remove empty pyqt5-doc/examples/webkit/googlechat directory
  * Add debian/pyqt5-doc.links to replace embedded copy of jquery.min.js in
    the fancybrowser example with a symlink to the existing copy in the html
    documentation
  * Add debian/patches/fix-example-shebang to remove a buggy and unneeded
    shebang in examples/sql/connection.py
  * Set X-Python3-Version: >= 3.3 in debian/control as a temporary workaround
    to a dh_python3 issue with extension renaming
